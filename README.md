# dotfiles

These are Claire's dotfiles.

They aren't designed to be cloned or installed or anything snazzy like that, they're just a collection of scripts, settings and notes that Claire has used in the past, and therefore might be helpful when setting up a new machine.

## Git aliases

I really like typing `git s` fot `git status`. You can set an alias in your `.bash_profile` file, or set it as a Git alias with the following command:

```
git config --global alias.s status
```
