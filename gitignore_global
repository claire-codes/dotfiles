# This file contains a list of rules that will match files/folders, that you want to exclude globally.
# It saves you from creating a .gitignore in every personal project and filling it with the same stuff.
#
# Create this file in your home directory as a hidden file (.gitignore_global) and set it in your global settings:
#
# git config --global core.excludesfiles ~/.gitignore_global
#
# In every git repo on your machine from now on, you won't need to repeat the same patterns as are already in the globa file.
